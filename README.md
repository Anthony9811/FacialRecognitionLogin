# Facial Recognition Login
An iOS and Android app that uses facial recognition to provide 2-factor authentication for a login page. 

Built using [Xamarin.Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/?WT.mc_id=none-github-bramin) and [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://aka.ms/Axnics).

## Getting Started - iOS

To launch this app on a physical iOS device, you must create a custom Provisioning Profile that uses an App Groups Entitlement. 

The Xamarin Developer docs have a walkthough to accomplish this: https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/application_fundamentals/working-with-app-groups/

Note that BundleIDs and AppGroups are case-sensitive. I recommend using only lowercase letters for the app group name and BundleId.
